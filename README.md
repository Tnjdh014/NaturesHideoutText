# NaturesHideoutText
A simple graphic that utilizes the Z-index and Parralax scrolling which makes the text move behind the background 

It's a visual effect that gives depth to a website by moving different page elements at different speeds. Often, the background of the website moves at a slower speed compared to elements in the foreground, just like landmarks in the distance move more slowly in your visual field compared with things that are up close. This creates an optical illusion as you scroll through the page.
Websites can use parallax scrolling for a variety of effects. Here are two examples:

-Example 1: [Firewatch](https://www.firewatchgame.com/) simulates an immersive gameplay experience


-Example 2: [Anton & Irene](https://antonandirene.com/) appear to personally present information about their work
